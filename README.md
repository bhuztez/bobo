# Bobo

Bobo is a low-cost, decentralized alternative to boism.org, the mostly
inaccessible fansite of bboczeng. It is named after the very popular
song of bobo, "bobos, they make your feet feel fine, bobos, they cost
a nickle and a dime."

Bobo is at very early stage of development. You may take a look at
[demo.py](demo.py) to get basic ideas of bobo.
