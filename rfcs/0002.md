# 0002 FZone over SSH

## Introduction

This document defines presentation layer of FZone, when SSH is used as
session layer protocol.

## Request

When either side wishes to send a request, they should open a new
channel for it. For channel request, they should open a channel of
type 'fzone-chan', and send the hex encoded verify key of the FZone
channel in channel type specific data. And for blob request, they
should open a channel of type 'fzone-blob', and send the hex encoded
blob ID in channel type specific data.

For response, after all data had been sent, SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF must
be sent before a channel is closed.
